		<h3 id="h3">About Us </h3>
		<p id="p">We, the youth, refuse to live in a society where our women have to survive with the dreadful burden of oppression, crimes including rape, torture and violence, gender discrimination and female foeticide. We strongly oppose this scenario where the women of this world, those women who bring life on earth, who nurture the lives, family, fill lives of her dear ones with utmost love and care, who guards and shades her family while facing danger, is subjected to such brutal humiliation almost everyday in major parts of the world.  We realize that it is the call of this hour to make people aware, that even if the evil tries to subdue our women, they won’t break own, they won’t lose hope, they will fight; fight till their last breath and contribute and inspire the world and other women to fight in their own way, and one day, there will be a Revolution. We can see now that women have been able to successfully create the change and contribute in all fields of life like social, economic, agricultural, scientific, sports, entertainment, politics, army, education, environment, business and entrepreneurship and family. It is very truly said that men and women stand equal, one is incomplete without the other, and no one is less than the other.  

		We believe, we have the skills, passion, ingenuity, courage, commitment, zeal to achieve excellence and most importantly , a heart, mind and soul to connect with all the women around to transform their tears of grievances into smiles of well-being and prosperity and pride. We encourage all women, from any part of the world, all the women who are unsung heroes in real life, to come up with their story of success, their story of overcoming the hurdles thrown at them by the society, the story of their fight, their story of inspiration. We, through our website, give all the women a platform to share their extraordinary and unique story of their fight and life.  

		A woman is a creator of humanity, she is our strength our pride, hence we encourage all to celebrate womanhood each and every moment to pay tribute to all the women who silently and constantly keep supporting us whether leading us from front or keeping a hand on our shoulder and constantly guiding us from behind.  

		‘This website, that we created, is a tribute an a small gift for all women and it also marks the celebration of Womanhood by all youth students like us who owe a lot to the women  

		like our mothers, teachers and sisters.’ </p>
