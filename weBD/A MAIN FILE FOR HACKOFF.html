			<h1 id='head'>Our Women- Celebrating Womanhood each and every moment</h1>
			<h2 id="h2">A TRIBUTE TO OUR WOMEN</h2>

			<p id="p1">Throughout history, the central role of women in society has ensured the stability, progress and long-term development of nations. Women are the primary caretakers of children and elders in every country of the world. International studies demonstrate that when the economy and political organization of a society change, women take the lead in helping the family adjust to new realities and challenges. It is the mother in the family who most often urges children of both genders to attend – and stay – in school.  The role of women is at the front end of the chain of improvements leading to the family’s, the community’s long-term capacity. Despite significant obstacles, women’s small businesses in rural developing communities not only can be an extended family’s lifeline, but can form a networked economic foundation for future generations. The role of women in the urban and rural workforce has expanded exponentially in recent decades. Women are the key to sustainable development and quality of life in the family. The varieties of role the women assume in the family are those of wife, leader, administrator, manager of family income and last but not the least important the mother. Woman is man’s helpmate, partner and comrade. She sacrifices her personal pleasure and ambitions, sets standard of morality, relieves stress and strain, tension of husband, maintains peace and order in the household. She is the source of inspiration to man for high endeavour and worth achievements in life. She stands by him in all the crises as well as she shares with him all successes and attainments. She is the person to whom he turns for love, sympathy, understanding, comfort and recognition. She is the symbol of purity, faithfulness and submission and devotion to her husband. She is the first teacher of the child. She transmits social heritage to the child. It is from mother that the child learns the laws of the race, the manner of men, moral code and ideals. The mother, because of her intimate and sustained contact with the child, she is able to discover and nurture child’s special traits aptitudes and attitudes which subsequently play a key role in the shaping of his personality. </p>


			<p id="p3">WHAT IS BEING A WOMAN?</p>

			

			<p id="p2"> 

			Being a woman means sharing a special connection that extends beyond race, age, sexuality, political opinions and physicality. It’s something that bonds us together on a level that only women understand. It’s magic. We are magic. It’s an uphill, hard fight against the fear of our power that started way beyond our lifetime. Being a woman means following my gut, trusting my intuition and feeling connected to the moon and the earth. Having the ability to love fully and to care for and nurture for things around me, in a way that only women can. Questioning what I’ve been told makes me beautiful. Questioning what I’ve been told are my limits. It means standing up for the right to have a different opinion, and standing up for women I disagree with and don’t like. Being a woman is a gift I’ll never give up, and I’ll always fight to keep safe. </p>
