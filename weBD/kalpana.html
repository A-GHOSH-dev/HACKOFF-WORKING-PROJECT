	<p style="text-align: center;"  id="p">Whether it’s a list about the world’s most powerful businesswomen or one that talks about the most successful CEOs in the world, it’s a rarity that Indra Nooyi misses that list. Even though she was born in Chennai to a conservative middle-class family, Nooyi was not one to conform to norms. Breaking traditions, she was a part of a girl-band and also played cricket. But it was her genius mind that took her forward. A student of IIM-Calcutta and then the Yale School of Management, Nooyi carved her own path to success. She started her journey with Johnson & Johnson and then worked with Boston Consulting Group. She joined PepsiCo in 1994 as the Chief Strategist. She quickly climbed the corporate ladder and became the CEO in 2006. In the 44 years of PepsiCo then, she was the 5th CEO. Nooyi is also responsible for many of PepsiCo’s leading achievements. She helped make one of the biggest food deals in corporate history when Pepsi acquired Quaker Oats for $13.4 billion. Since she has been at the helm of the company, PepsiCo’s shares have gained 78 per cent. Being a woman leader, Nooyi has often spoken about gender inclusion at the workplace. Reports suggest that Nooyi would also watch replays of Chicago Bulls championship games to learn more about teamwork. Former Pepsi CEO Steven Reinemund has called Nooyi "a deeply caring person" who "can relate to people from the boardroom to the front line." Calm, composed and dignified that’s what best defines Indra Nooyi, the woman who shattered the glass ceiling and took PepsiCo to newer heights. The world sees Ms. Nooyi as one of the most powerful woman leaders because of her impeccable leadership skills and intelligence.  </p>
