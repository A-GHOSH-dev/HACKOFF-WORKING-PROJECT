	<p style="text-align: center;"  id="p">Standing at a mere five-feet while she was alive is a woman whose memory towers over the world to this day. Poor, marginalized, small in stature, and a woman, she had the makings of obscurity, but these were features that did not define her spirit or her message. Her love and compassion gained the attention of princesses and world leaders, earned her a Noble Peace Prize, and touched the hearts of everyday men and women around the world—forcing the world to re-examine their own priorities, hearts, and minds. As we continue to celebrate Women’s History Month, by featuring empowering women, this week Love Happens is honouring the powerful life and work of Mother Teresa. With the support of the Catholic Church eventually the Missionaries of Charity was formed. Today the charity has surpassed 4,000 members with a mission to care for “the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone”. This woman of physical and material mediocrity shook the world through her selfless devotion to the poor, proving that It is not our successes that define or empower us, it is the potential for goodness and selflessness that exists in every human heart that has the true capacity to change the world. It is this forceful essence of love that Mother Teresa leaves behind that reminds us of the power that resides in us all. So long as we have a heart and a mind centred around love, we are empowered to make a difference in the lives of many.   </p>
