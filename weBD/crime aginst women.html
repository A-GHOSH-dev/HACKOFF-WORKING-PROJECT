        <h1>VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN </h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p1> Violence against women in India refers to physical or sexual violence committed on Indian women. Mostly such
            violent acts are committed by the men, or in rare case a woman might also be involved. Most common forms of
            violence against Indian women are domestic abuse and sexual assault.
            For an act to qualify as “violence against women”, it must be committed only because the victim is a female.
            “Violence against women” in India is widely prevalent, mainly due to long lasting gender inequality present for
            centuries.</p1>
            <p2>The Indian Statics. The National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) of India has the responsibility of publishing the
            crime data including violence against women. The last annual report released by NCRB in August 2018, has
            indicated towards an increased rate of violence against Indian women.
            Cases of sexual violence against women in India have jumped up by over 10% than the preceding years and rape
            accounts for 12% of all the crimes committed against women. Delhi stands highest for reported rape cases at 30%
            followed by Sikkim at 22%.
            However, it must be kept in mind that these figures are not actual as many cases of rape and domestic violence
            go unreported.</p2>

        <h3>Types of Violence against Women -</h3>
            <p3>
            There are many types of crimes that come under the category of violence against women. Some of the most common
            forms of violence against women committed in India are listed below-
            <ul>
                <li> Sexual Assault on a woman refers to the situation where a person intentionally makes inappropriate physical
            contact with a woman without her consent or forces her into a sexual act. It is a sexual violence and includes
            crimes like – rape, drugs induced sexual assaults, child sexual abuse and groping.</li>
                <li>Domestic violence against women is carried out in a domestic environment. Many cases of domestic violence in
            India’s patriarchal society go unreported. It includes physical abuse of a woman, by her in laws, husband or
            relatives. Social evils like dowry system, gender inequality are primarily responsible for domestic violence
            against women.</li>
                <li>Honor killing refers to the murder of a family members who has supposedly brought shame to the family by going
            against the family’s will on issues like arranged marriage, by choosing a partner from other caste or in some
            cases by committing adultery.</li>
            <li>Throughout India cases of young girls going missing are continuously reported. These girls are supposedly lured
            on the pretext of securing a job or earning money and send to other states and subsequently forced into
            prostitution.</li>
                </ul>

            </p3>

        <h3>Causes of Violence against women in India -</h3>
            <p4>
            
            <ul>
                <li> Indian society is male dominated society where women don’t have the rights to make major decisions related to
            the family. Moreover, researches revealed that almost 60% of males in India think that women in the family must
            be beaten from time to time. This societal setup always keeps women at a vulnerable position.</li>
                <li>Domestic violence committed on a woman has a tendency to be carried over to the next generation. A child who
            watches his father physically abusing his mother is most likely to do the same to his wife when he grows up.
            Nuclear families have more reported incidents of violence against women as there is no elder person to intervene
            and settle the matter.
    </li>
                <li>Regular consumption of liquor by the husband is prime cause for violence against women in a family. Alcohol is
            not only responsible for domestic violence against women but also crimes committed against women outside the
            houses. Alcohol stimulates the offender’s or victims cognitive skills, fuelling the violence.</li>
                </ul>
           

            
            </p4>

        <h3>Solutions and Preventive Measures -</h3>
            <p5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Police vigil must be increased in all the areas, especially in the secluded areas during night. Police presence
            significantly reduces the chance of a woman getting assaulted or harassed by others on the road. Police officers
            must be deployed at crowded places like markets, as the women at these places are more susceptible to crimes
            like eve teasing or groping.</li>
                    <li> Initiatives taken by the community itself towards curbing violence against women, is the best way to counter
            domestic violence and as well as other crimes against women. The Nari Adalat program introduced in Uttar Pradesh
            by Department of Education has proved instrumental in reducing domestic violence against women.</li>
                    <li>Many acts of sexual violence against women are committed in trains or buses mainly during late hours. Offenders
            take advantage of the secluded vehicle and absence of police personnel. There is a need to deploy at least one
            woman police constable in buses or rail coaches during late night hours.</li>
                    </ul>
            Violence against Indian women is a blot on the nation and the society as well. As long as the Indian women are
            subjected to violence, the international image of India is also going to suffer. Also, incidents of domestic
            violence, sexual assaults and other similar crimes on women will continuously damage Indian society and
            obstructs national progress. Therefore, it is imperative to take stringent counter measures to diminish any kind
            of violence against Indian women.</p5>


        <h3>ISSUES AND PROBLEMS FACED BY WOMEN IN INDIA </h3>

        <p6>Earlier women were facing problems like child marriage, sati pratha, parda pratha, restriction to widow
            remarriage, widows exploitation, devadasi system, etc. However, almost all the old traditional problems have
            been disappeared gradually from the society but given rise to other new issues. Women are continuously facing
            many problems even after having self-confidence, individuality, self-respect, personality, capacity, talent, and
            efficiency more than men. They are facing problems in their daily life even after they are given equal rights
            and opportunities like men by the Constitution of India. Some of the major problems modern women are still
            facing mentioned below:

            <ul>
                <li>Violence against women: Women are getting affected by the various violence almost every day which is disrupting
            the society. Women are being victims of violence at huge level day by day because of increasing crimes against
            women (according to the report of Crime Record Bureau of the Central Home Ministry). Woman is getting kidnapped
            at every 44 minutes, raped at every 47 minutes, 17 dowry deaths every day, etc. They may face violence within
            the family (dowry related harassment, death, marital rape, wife-battering, sexual abuse, deprivation of healthy
            food, female genital mutilation, etc) or outside the family (kidnapping, rape, murder, etc).</li>
                <li>Gender discrimination: Women are considered as weaker section of the society than men and given less importance.
            Girls children are becoming real victims of the discrimination. There are also discrimination of power and work
            between men and women because of the patriarchal system families in India. Gender discrimination affects women
            in the areas like nutrition, education, health, care, decline of female population, job, public life, etc.</li>
                <li> Problems of female education: Women education percentage is low in India especially in the rural areas because
            they are discouraged for higher education like professional and technical education.</li>
            <li>Problems related to unemployment: Women are getting more problem in searching their suitable work. They become
            more prone to the exploitation and harassment in the work areas.
            They are given more work and hard tasks by their boss intentionally. They have to prove their devotion,
            seriousness and sincerity towards work time to time.
            Women who are uneducated more prone to divorce and desertion by their husbands on any stage of life. They have
            to live whole life with fear of divorce. In some cases they have to finish their life because of unbearable
            conditions.</li>
            <li>Dowry system is another huge women problem in the society which is increasing day by day. Women are ill-treated,
            man-handled, disrespected, tortured and suffer other cruelties (violence, murder and suicide) because of the
            lack of dowry at the time of marriage. It cause degradation of women status to a great extent.</li>
                </ul>
            </p6>
            <p7>There are various rules, regulations, act and laws made by the Indian government regarding the safety of women
            in India. However, a new act (Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Bill, 2015) has been passed by
            the Indian government by replacing the earlier one of 2000 (Indian juvenile delinquency law of 2000) to reduce
            the juvenile age from 18 to 16 years especially in case of heinous offenses (after Nirbhaya case).
    </p7>
            

        <h3> BARRIERS TO EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN IN INDIA </h3>

        <p8>Women have suffered at the hands of the male members of the community since the beginning of the times. They
            haven’t been given their due place in the society. Their role in the society has been defined by the males.
            
            <ul>
                <li>In India, particularly the women are suppressed in the name of culture and tradition. However, it is time we
            must open our minds and let go of this old way of thinking to empower the women for their own good as well as
            the overall well-being of our society.</li>
                <li>The culture and tradition of our country is such that it restricts the women and confines them within the four
            walls of their houses. The tradition of our country expects a woman to do the household chores, cook for her
            family, take care of the elders and raise children. It is believed that this is her sole responsibility and this
            is what she is born for.</li>
                <li>A woman who steps out defying the set norms of the society is considered to lack virtue. This is one of the
            major barriers to the empowerment of women in our society. Though women in the metropolitans and other big
            cities around the country have joined various professions and are making it big in this male-driven world,
            people living in the rural areas are still not open about the idea of females seeking education and working.
            Woman in most parts of our country are dominated by the males. They are not even given the basic right to
            education and have no say in the family or business matters.</li>
            <li>Family responsibilities are another hindrance to women empowerment. While men are allowed to act carelessly,
            women are expected to act responsibly at all times. Taking care of her kids, her husband’s parents and household
            chores is her main responsibility. She needs to fulfil these responsibilities in order to prove that she is a
            good mother, a good wife and a good daughter or a good daughter in law.If she doesn’t do these tasks properly and tries to concentrate on her profession just like her male counterpart
            then she is tagged as an irresponsible woman. Many women give up on their jobs and stay financially dependent on
            the male members of their house as they are not able to handle the stress caused trying to manage both the roles
            efficiently. Men must share the family responsibilities to stop this injustice against women. They must be held
            equally responsible for the household chores.</li>
            <li>The mindset of the male members of our community is yet another barrier to women empowerment. Women who go out
            to work or seek education are scared of travelling alone during the late evening hours as it is not safe for
            them. The male members of our community leave no chance to harass or take advantage of the women.
            The growing numbers of rape cases are a clear evidence of the same. This serves as yet another barrier to women
            empowerment. Many families do not allow their daughters/ daughter in laws to go out for the fear they might face
            problems. A woman is not allowed to work as freely as men. She has to think twice before working over time or
            going for an official trip owing to safety issues. This hampers her professional growth.</li>
                </ul>
            
            Women empowerment is a serious issue. Women must be empowered so that they can lead a better life. They must be
            educated and trained to be financially independent. In addition to it, they must be provided a safe environment
            to live freely and independently.</p8>
