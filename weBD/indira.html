	<p style="text-align: center;"  id="p">15 years ago, the world watched in horror as the US space shuttle Columbia disintegrated while reentering the earth’s atmosphere. All seven crew members on board were lost; one of them was Indian-American Kalpana Chawla, the first woman of Indian origin to go to space. Although Kalpana’s second space flight ended in disaster, she is remembered as an extraordinary woman, an inspiration, and a role model. She set a mighty example for being courageous, dedicated, and an independent woman who set her eyes on space and followed through with her dream. With an aim to join NASA, Chawla moved to the United States in 1982. She went on to obtain a Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1984 and got her second Master's degree in 1986. Not stopping there, she went on to earn a doctorate in aerospace engineering from the University of Colorado at Boulder. In 1988, she took another step closer to her dream, joining NASA, and in 1997 she went on her first space flight. Her determination and grit has been an inspiration to little girls, and strong women across the world.  </p>
