    <h3>Women’s rights in India</h3>
    <p3>Due to the dire situation in India when it comes to women’s safety, women’s rights in India have been in the limelight of late. Some of the important rights of women are as follow:
        <ul>
            <li>Discrimination on the basis of gender is prohibited by the Constitution of India.</li>
            <li>Women are entitled to equal pay as their male counterparts for work.</li>
            <li>Female rape victims have the right to free legal aid and the right to remain anonymous.</li>
            <li>Women cannot be arrested after sunset and before sunrise, unless in exceptional circumstances.</li>
            <li>Women have the right to file First Information Reports or FIRs in any police station, even if such police station does not have jurisdiction with respect to the offence.</li>
            <li>Women have special rights with regard to inheritance of property.</li>
            <li>Women also have certain protective rights against sexual harassment at the workplace and harassment due to dowry demands etc.</li>
            </ul>
        
        </p3>
    <h3>Laws for women in India</h3>
    <p4>
        <ol>
            <li>Marriage and family matters</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 defines a ‘child’ as a boy under the age of 21 and a girl under the age of 18. This means that the marriage of a girl below the age of 18 is considered to be child marriage and is prohibited by the law. There are certain contradictions to this rule in personal laws. However, it is important for you, as parents, to understand the importance of encouraging your daughters to continue their education and empowering them in other ways rather than marrying them off at a young age.</li>
                <li>The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 lays down the law regarding abortion in India. Right now, it is not easy to get an abortion even in cases of rape as this Act sets a number of conditions. However, this Act is soon to be amended.</li>
                <li>Domestic violence is prohibited by law and is considered to be a criminal offence according to S. 498-A of the Indian Penal Code. Certain provisions in the Indian Evidence Act and the Criminal Procedure Code also deal with this issue. Finally, a legislation devoted to this issue was enacted in 2005 – The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act.</li>
                <li>Another common problem faced by married women is harassment from their in-laws for dowry. To battle this social evil, the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 was enacted, criminalising this practice. However, it still continues. It is important that parents do not give in to societal pressures and ensure that they do not provide dowry in any form.</li>
                <li>While Indian law does not criminalise pre-marital sex as long as it is between consenting adults, there are no laws regulating live-in relationships. However, courts have developed laws on this subject through decisions in cases to such an extent that the law against domestic violence applies to couples who are in live-in relationships and children born out of such relationships are treated as legitimate in certain circumstances.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Sexual abuse and exploitation</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Various forms of sexual harassment such as singing lewd songs, eve-teasing, making sexual advances in spite of refusal, watching, capturing or sharing images and other media of a woman engaging in a private act without prior consent have all been criminalised by the Indian Penal Code. There is an entire legislation dedicated to sexual harassment in the workplace – Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013.</li>
                <li>As parents, it is important that you are aware of your daughters’ activities on the Internet. Today, many crimes against women are committed by sexual predators through online portals. Online harassment of women is prohibited under S. 67 of the Information Technology Act.</li>
                <li>Any indecent representation of women is banned by the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986. This law, as it is considered to be too narrow for this day and age, has undergone certain changes and an Amendment Bill was drafted in 2012 which broadened its scope.</li>
                <li>Ss. 375 and 376(2) of The Indian Penal Code criminalise rape. These sections spell out 7 years’ and 10 years’ imprisonment, respectively, as the punishment for rape. The key feature of these sections is the requirement for consent by the woman in question for the act not to be considered as rape. Thus, as a parent it is important that you explain the concept of consent to your daughters at an early age. Intercourse with a woman of unsound mind or a girl below 16 years of age is considered to be rape irrespective of consent being given. Unfortunately, marital rape has not yet been criminalised.</li>    
            </ul>
            <li> Property laws</li>
            <ul>
                <li>While traditionally, the rights of women with regard to succession and inheritance of property in India were next to non-existent, as of now, according to the amendments to the Hindu Succession Act in 2005, daughters have been given the same rights as sons with regard to inheritance and succession.</li>
                <li>The Indian Succession Act does not differentiate between the heirs of the deceased.</li>
                <li>Muslim women enjoy rights of inheritance though limited to some extent by custom and practice.</li>
                </ul>


            <li>Women in the workplace:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Women in India have the right to earn as much as men and gender discrimination is also prohibited at the time of recruitment. Ss. 4 and 5 of the Equal Remunerations Act, 1976 lay down the law regarding this.</li>
                <li>The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 has brought about certain groundbreaking laws which concern working women including the increase of paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks (S.5(3)) and ‘work from home’ options for new mothers (S.5(5)).</li>
                
                </ul>

            <li>Organisations that help</li>
            <ul>
                 <li>There are a number of organisations that work for the upliftment and protection of women such as the National Commission for Women, One Stop Crisis Centres (or) Nirbhaya Centres, National Association of Rural Women India, etc. There are also a number of NGOs working for women’s rights. Please keep your daughter informed of these organisations so that she knows who to approach in case of a crisis.</li>
                 </ul>
        </ol>

    <h3>Constitutional provisions to ensure dignity of women</h3>
    <p5> 
        <ol>
            <li>Article 14:- Article 14 of constitution of India ensures equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. This is a very important provision which provides equal legal protection to women against any women based crime. This provision also paves way for the introduction of various laws and acts to ensure protection and enforcement of legal rights of women in India.</li>
            <li>Article 15:- Article 15 of constitution of India ensures that no one should create any sort of discrimination only on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth or any of them within the territory of India. At the time of Independence there was lots of discrimination in India against women which gradually abolished after introduction of article 15. As per article 15(3) of the constitution state has the authority to make any special provision for women and children.</li>
            <li>Article 16:- Article 16 of constitution of India ensures equal employment opportunity to every citizen of India. As per article 16 there should not be any discrimination in respect of employment opportunity under the State only on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, and place of birth, residence or any of them. Now we can see women are doing really good work in politics and in corporate sector. Presently they are holding responsible positions in Government and Government run institutions. Let me share few good names from political and corporate field. These names are Chanda kochhar, Indira nooyi, Sonia Gandhi, Sushma Swaraj and this never ending list goes on.</li>
            <li>Article 39:- Article 39 of constitution of India ensures the benefit of the directive principles of state policy to the women. Directive principles of state policy mean guiding principles for the framing of laws by the government at state level. Article 39(a) of directive principles of state policy ensures and directs a state to apply policies which focus on a men and women have an equal right of adequate means of livelihood and article 39(c) ensures equal pay for equal work for both men and women.</li>
            <li>Article 42:- Article 42 of constitution of India caste a duty on every employer to ensure just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief. In reality the position and treatment of women in corporate offices is really bad and in fact they are exploited by their seniors and bosses. In this scenario the provisions of article 42 are very important and now it is duty of employer to provide good working conditions to all the employees.</li>
            <li>Article 243:- Article 243 of constitution of India ensures reservation of seats in gram panchayat for women. This opportunity of being a part of local level arbitration process has improved the social conditions of women in village areas.</li>
        </ol>
    </p5>


    <h3>Parliamentary provisions to ensure dignity of women</h3>

    <p6>
        <ol>
            <li>Adultery :- Adultery is a very serious crime against women in India and affects married women by and large. In simple words adultery means having voluntary sexual relationship with a married person other than the spouse. The offence of adultery is dealt with by section 497 of the Indian penal Code, 1860, which says adultery means sexual intercourse of a man with a married woman without the consent of her husband when such sexual intercourse does not amount to rape. However we may find different meaning of adultery in different laws in different countries. Initially only men were punished under the law of adultery in India but now men and women both are equally responsible for committing the crime of adultery. As per section 497, the offender shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine, or with both. In such case the wife shall not be punishable as a partner in crime.</li>
            <li>Child marriage :-Child marriage is a very awful offence against child as it does not only harms the future of child but also damage social values. Further the doctors have also revealed that child marriage is a very big reason for bad health condition for girl child. Child marriage restricts the social development along with reduction in the educational and employment opportunities in the global market. It was like a burden on society to practice this unwritten custom. The major step was taken by the Law Commission of India by fixing the minimum age for marriage which is 18 years for girls and 21 years for boys. Another major step was mandatory primary education and moreover for girls provision for free education provided by the Government of India.</li>
            <li>Female foeticides: -Female feticide means identifying and killing of female fetus before they take birth. This is the most brutal way of killing women. The custom of female feticide is practiced by the society form ancient times and it is really shameful to note that even today, when we considers ourselves educated and civilized, this custom is practiced in a big manner. Government has taken so many steps to spread awareness among people about the consequences of this crime. Many awareness programs are conducted by the Government to spread the awareness about the physical, mental and social effect of this practice. Punishment of 3 years imprisonment and Rs. 10,000 fine has been prescribed by Pre conception and Pre Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex selection) Act, 1994, for the offence of Female feticides. In a recently development Maharashtra government has recommend to the centre that the crime of female feticide should be treated as murder. To ensure this amendment in Pre conception and Pre Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex selection) Act, 1994, (PCPNDT Act, 1994) would become necessary. This provision will bring this crime within the category of murder under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).</li>
            <li>Trafficking and Prostitution :-Trafficking means import and export of humans for sex business. It is indeed very sad to learn that in India, where women are recognized as Devi and prayed by all Indian's as Devi Shakti, they are also treated as a source of earning by unethical means. Prostitution is one of the biggest problems in this world which is damaging the women in many ways. In general, the term prostitution means offer of sexual services for earning money. Prostitution is a problem which exists across the world. There are quite a few laws in India in order to prevent the crime of prostitution like Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girl Act 1956 and Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act 1956. There are few commissions are made by state Government to save women and specially girls to protect them from this practice.</li>
            <li>Domestic Violence:- Domestic violence has become a very serious problem for women. In general the term Domestic violence means mental, physical, emotional and economical harassment of a woman by family members. For the purpose of domestic violence family includes spouse, his mother, father, brother, sister, his relatives and sometimes even friends. We call ourselves educated and talk too much about morality, ethics and civilization and expect others to be good to create a dream world but forget that without giving due respect to the women, a nation's growth is impossible. Now in India domestic violence is recognized as a criminal offence under section 498A of Indian Penal Code, 1860. Domestic violence means cruelty by husband towards women. Cruelty can be done by physically, mentally, economically or emotionally. An act called Domestic violence Act, 2005 was introduced to handle the cases of Domestic violence in India. This act is a very noteworthy attempt in India to recognize domestic violence as a punishable offence. Before the introduction of this act two kinds of remedies were available to a women affected by Domestic violence. These two remedies were divorce through civil courts and application of section 498A through criminal courts.</li>
            <li>Eve teasing: - It is a general perception that eve teasing is not a big crime like rape or murder and may be because of that we don't take it seriously. But from a women's point of view eve teasing is also a very big crime as this activity does make her feel uncomfortable most of the times. Eve teasing usually involves teasing women, passing comments on women and making vulgar signs (eshare). A woman has to face this kind of irritating behavior and deal with this on daily basis. She can't even fight back due to fear of disrespect by others as everyone will blame her and say that you must have done something to invite them. In case of eve teasing girl should not remain silent and raise her voice. She should inform her family members and simultaneously file a complaint in the nearest police station. In this case family should also support the women instead of locking her at home.</li>
            <li>Acid throwing:- Recently the issue of acid throwing on girls has also become a big issue. There are few types of acids and all are very dangerous for human flash and burn. This acid attack sometimes is so dangerous that even bones and eyes are also got damaged due to acid. Few victims are forced to leave their education or occupation due to the results of acid throwing. Now a days this has become very easy for people to get these acids and the cases of acid throwing has become very regular in daily life. It is quite sad that despite of so many cases of acid attacks on women, we do not have a dedicated and specific law to deal with such cases. The National Commission for Women (NCW) is asked for a well defined law to deal with such casualties. The NCW has introduced a draft of the Prevention of Offences (by Acids) Act, 2008, which is with now with the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development for the purpose of vetting and final recommendations. Once the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development approved the Bill, it will be sent to the law ministry to be tabled in Parliament. After the approval in Parliament it will become applicable as law.</li>
            <li>Fraudulent Marriage:- Before going into the details of Fraudulent Marriage let me explain the general meaning of fraud in relation to crime against women. Fraud means hiding something or giving false impression about something which a person knows that knowing the fact may harm his prospective marriage. The scope of fraudulent marriage has increased in the recent past as in India parents of a girl are very fond of NRI son in law. Parents want to settle their daughter with any rich NRI. Parents of brides don't inquire too much about the NRI groom as they are happy that their daughter is going to marry a rich person who will fulfill her all demands and she will live a luxurious life in abroad. There blind faith on NRI's may invite problems like false commitments, false details, second marriage and infertility. This is not necessary that fraudulent marriages only took place in case of NRI's even Indian grooms also do the same for money or for boy child or for any other reason.</li>
            <li>Exploitation at work place:- Though we all accept the truth that in today's world women has come out of her image of house wife and proved herself as a better administrator then a man. In all sectors women are working hard and getting awards and rewards for that. She has crossed all the boundaries and shut the mouth of all those peoples who has ever questioned her working caliber. But she has to pay a very heavy price of her success as she has to face exploitation at work place do we ever think what boundaries she has crossed and how. What she had paid go get this position and power? How much pain she has felt to become this person.</li>
            <li>Rape, murder: - Rape is another very serious crime against women and this crime is increasing day by day like anything. Reporting of rape and abduction cases has become very common in print and electronic media which is indeed a very sad affair for all of us. Increasing rape cases are enough to prove that our moral values are still very low and we still to learn how to respect the dignity of women at large. In simple terms the word ‘Rape' means sexual intercourse or sexual penetration, by another person without the consent of the other person or victim. Provisions related to rape are given in section 375 and 376 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Section 375 explains the pre-condition which are necessary tp prove the offence of rape whereas section 376 provides punishment for the offence of rape. As per section 376, whoever commits the offence of rape shall be punished with imprisonment of either for a term which shall not be less than seven years (7) but which may be for life or for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine.</li>
            <li>Dowry:- The system of dowry is another social evil which dragging women back from 100 of years as this evil has a very long history especially in India. Various dowry based domestic violence cases has been reported by media. There are ample legal provisions in India to provide relief to women in case of dowry based domestic violence cases. Civil law of India has prohibited the payment of dowry in the year 1961. Further Indian Penal Code, 1860 has introduced Sections 304B and 498A, which allows women to file complaint and seek restoration of her rights from serious harassment by the husband's family. Dowry is one of the strong and biggest reasons of increasing domestic violence. Every year thousands of dowry deaths along with mental trauma cases reported and registered in India. In case of inadequate dowry, incidents like burning, suicides, physical and mental torture of women is very common by husband and his family. Keeping in view the increasing cases of dowry deaths another legislative provision called “Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005", was introduced in order to reduce domestic violence cases and to protect women's rights.</li>
