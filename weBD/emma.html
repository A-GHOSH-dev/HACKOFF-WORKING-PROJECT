	<p style="text-align: center;"  id="p">Emmeline Pankhurst is one of the most eminent political activists in history and has been named one of Time’s 100 Most Important People of the 20th century. Interested in politics from a young age, Pankhurst was destined to make history. As the leader of the suffragette movement, Pankhurst campaigned tirelessly to achieve the right to vote for women from 1889 when she created the Women’s Franchise League to the year she died in 1928, consequently she same year that women of 21 years and over were given the right to vote. In 1903 Pankhurst founded the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU) which became unstoppable in advocating for women’s rights. Led by Pankhurst, the WSPU members demonstrated and protested, leading eventually to violent altercations with the police. In a series of window-smashing campaigns by the suffragettes in 1912, hundreds of women including Pankhurst were imprisoned. The fight carried on in prison with the women going on hunger strikes which led to violent force-feedings. It was not until 16 years later that women aged 21 and over were given the right to vote. Pankhurst will be forever remembered for her integral role in gaining the right to vote for women. </p>
